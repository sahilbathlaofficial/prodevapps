description: CatchVYBZ, commonly referred to as VYBZ, is solving several of today’s issues in the food/nightlife/entertainment search and review space. VYBZ is a free, local-entertainment search app powered by a social media platform of crowd-sourced photos and videos. Users can search for places to go (restaurants, cafes, bars, clubs, hotels, etc.) based on the overall vibes, atmosphere, crowd, age demographic, liveliness, peak hours, and more. VYBZ will disrupt the current search & review environment as these reviews are in real time, cannot be tampered with, and provide an honest assessment of the atmosphere and offerings of your next destination.
